    "## Finding the Optimal Fantasy Basketball Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal of project:  \n",
    "Determine the optimal # of points for each stat in fantasy basketball in a Points for Stats League setting\n",
    "\n",
    "![display image](https://media1.tenor.com/images/1dd25d6d8b07d8f5649f446d7260dd3e/tenor.gif?itemid=14126049)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem statement:\n",
    "Fantasy basketball has maybe different game settings that provide a plethora of experiences. However, after many years of playing fantasy football and basketball, I still feel that the existing game modes in fantasy basketball all lag behind the excitement of fantasy football.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of game settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Categories  \n",
    "This seems like the most popular setting for fantasy basketball, in which there are 9 categories (FG%, FT%, 3PM, REB, PTS etc.) which players accumulate over the course of the week or the year. Whoever wins more categories in a matchup gets the win. The issue is, it's no fun rooting for players to accumulate a specific category. Additionally, there is complicated strategy that goes into this game mode that goes against actual basketball enjoyment. Winning strategies usually build their team to tank certain categories while flourishing in other ones. Therefore, being good in this setting is more about manipulation of the setting itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Points League  \n",
    "The simplest of all setting types. Points leagues only counts players' points and whoever's players score more points over the course of the week wins. This to me is more exciting than categories, since you are actually watching a singular score compete against your opponent. Unfortunately, this completely ignores all other stats and causes players like Andrew Wiggins to be super valuable (Andrew Wiggins scored more points that Nikola Jokic in the 2019-2020 season, him being a better fantasy player than Jokic doesn't seem right to me)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Points for Stats League  \n",
    "My current favorite game setting for fantasy basketball. This is similar to a points league, except a player gets a certain amount of points for each stat that he gets. It adds the excitement of a single accumulated score, as well adding depth and balance between player strengths by adding additional stats. However, even in this setting, there are two additional huge cons that I've experienced:  \n",
    "    * Lack of a game limit: Usually the winning strategy is to just play players who play the most games in a certain week. Some platforms add a game limit, but are never implemented correctly (you can still go over the limit in some ways). Additionally, there is a lot of daily setting of lineups to maximize your score which makes it time consuming. The Sleeper App actually created a new game mode that fixes this issue, requiring you to pick only one game per week for each player, making the # of games played equal for both teams  \n",
    "    * Uneven scoring from different stats: What should each stat be worth? Currently, the default setting in Sleeper is 1 point for both rebounds and assists, and 0.5 points per point etc. This is actually imbalancing the game by causing a lot of Centers and players who rebound well to be very valuable. Actual points scored are undervalued at the same time. __this is the issue that I will be solving with this project__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Setup\n",
    "Before we dive into the data, we will need to decide what \"optimal\" actually means. In other words, what should fantasy performance correlate with? Ideally, we will use a metric that is indicative of a player's basketball talent/performance. Here is a list of potential metrics to correlate with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. BPM / VORP  \n",
    "Box Plus Minus (BPM) is a basketball box score-based metric that estimates a basketball player’s contribution to the team when that player is on the court. Value Over Replacement Player is a metric based on BPM that normalizes pace of play. To read more about BPM and VORP, see here:\n",
    "https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "2. PER\n",
    "Player Efficiency Rating (PER) in creator's John Hollinger's words is \"The PER sums up all a player's positive accomplishments, subtracts the negative accomplishments, and returns a per-minute rating of a player's performance.\" To read more about PER, see here\n",
    "https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Hashtag Basketball Categorical Rankings\n",
    "These rankings are generally created for Categorical leagues, they give a good calculation of each players' performance in each category, and overall. Translating these rankings to Points for Stats Leagues would eliminate my personal strategic negatives of a Categorical league, but keep the overall rankings and balance. Additionally, you are able to alter the output to your league preferences by weighing each stat. Data scraped from:  \n",
    "https://hashtagbasketball.com/fantasy-basketball-rankings\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "4. NBA 2k Ratings\n",
    "These are ratings given to players in the video game NBA 2k which are supposed to reflect each player on an overall talent level. While all previous metrics are based off of player production and performance, these rankings are created by a personal committee based on the eye test.\n",
    "https://nba2kw.com/list/nba-2k21-all-player-ratings/\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will correlate fantasy points with VORP, PER, and two different Hashtag settings\n",

    "These advanced metrics are a good indicator of player performance, but how can we translate that to expected fantasy points? We will need to capture the distribution of these 3 metrics, and then shift these metrics appropriate to moreso match the our intended spread of fantasy points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements are:\n",
    "- Fantasy points scored should almost always be a positive value\n",
    "- Distribution should look like a left skewed distribution (because we expect a lot of players to perform mediocre because of minutes played and performance), or normal distribution\n",
    "- The top players should be around a value of ~40, to be around the current expected scoring on Sleeper for top players. This value is actually pretty arbitrary, and can scale up or down depending on preference. Additionally, we will want the bulk of other players to be around 15-20\n"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal settings a difficult to assess, as the definition of what is \"optimal\" is so up in the air. In reality, everyone's ideal settings and how they want to balance the points for each stat will be different. In this project, I initially thought performing multivariate linear regression would give clean settings for stats that are similar to the typical settings for a points for stats style fantasy basketball league. However, the results showed that it can stray far from that to produce useful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit from performing a regression like this, is that you are able to add stats like \"FGA\", \"FTA\" or any other stats that are not intuitive to know what their points should immediately be worth, and how they would balance out other steps. However, without adding restrictions, variables have a good chance of becoming numbers that are not ideal for fantasy basketball (like losing points for rebounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Future Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing overfitting?  \n",
    "The outputs that I am seeing is imbalanced to what the typical fantasy settings are. Perhaps the model is overfitting, and adding regularization would help achieve balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creation of custom tool with UI  \n",
    "As explained earlier, because everyone will have a different definition of what \"optimal\" settings is, it is difficult to produce a setting that will work for everyone. From my view, the most impactful path forward would be to add flexibility and make this an interactive tool for users to input their own preferences, and the code will output the optimal settings for that specific user. This will allow users to decide which stats they want to include in the scoring settings of their league, and also how they want to add bounds to each stat to balance it in their own preferred way."
